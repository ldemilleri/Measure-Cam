# Measure-Cam
OpenCV application capable of measuring objects, placed over a sheet of paper
It calculates the dimensions from the placed object with respect to a A4 DIN sheet of paper,
then it draws what it detects to be its outline and diplays the lenghts of each side in cm.

config.yml can be used to set up all dependencies with Anaconda  

This project is based on the course "Realtime Object Measurement" by Hasan Murtaza
